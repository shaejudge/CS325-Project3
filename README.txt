To Compile:
Enter "make tsp"

To get output of path from list of cities:
Enter "./tsp " + the name of the file, for example, "./tsp tsp_example_1.txt"

Design Decisions:
 The decision to use the Nearest Neighbor does not provide the optimal result, as it is a Greedy algorithm. Although, the Nearest Neighbor is a fairly simple algorithm to understand and code, and since our group was short a member, choosing a simpler algorithm made more sense to test.
